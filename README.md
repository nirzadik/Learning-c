# 📘 Learning C — My Programming Journey

Welcome to my **Learning C** repository!  
This repo contains all the exercises, mini-projects, and experiments I build while studying the C programming language.

The goal is to improve my understanding of programming fundamentals by writing real C programs and practicing good development habits (Git, VSCode, debugging, problem solving, etc.).
